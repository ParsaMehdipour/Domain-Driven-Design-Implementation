> Domain-Driven Design is a concept introduced by a programmer Eric Evans in 2004 in his book Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in Heart of Software.

It is an approach for architecting software design by looking at software in top-down approach.

**What is Domain ?**
The word Domain used in context of software development refers to business. 
In the process of application development, term domain logic or business logic is commonly used. Basically, business logic is area of knowledge around which application logic revolves. 
The business logic of an application is a set of rules and guidelines that explain how business object should interact with each other to process modeled data.

DDD refers to the application's problem space - the business - as the domain. A domain is consists of multiple subdomains. 
Each subdomain corresponds to a different part of the business. 
Subdomains can be classified as follows: Core - key differentiator for the business and the most valuable part of the application.

# Domain :
A domain defines the area of operation of you or your used application. The definition of a DDD domain by Andrew Powell-Morse is: Domain in the realm of software engineering commonly refers to the subject area on which the application is intended to apply.
